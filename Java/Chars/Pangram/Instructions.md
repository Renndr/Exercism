# Font Company Pangram Checker

## Introduction

You are employed by a company that specializes in selling fonts through its website. The company aims to display a unique sentence each time someone views a font on their website. In order to provide a comprehensive representation of the font, these random sentences should incorporate all the letters in the English alphabet.

The company has initiated a competition to collect suggestions for sentences that meet this criterion, and you are responsible for evaluating the submissions to ensure their validity.

**Note:** The term "Pangram" is derived from the Greek words "παν γράμμα" (pan gramma), which translates to "every letter."

The most well-known English pangram is:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

## Instructions

Your primary task is to determine whether a given sentence is a pangram.

A pangram is defined as a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is case insensitive, meaning the case of the letters (lowercase or uppercase) does not affect the evaluation. In other words, a letter appearing in either lowercase (e.g., k) or uppercase (e.g., K) is considered equivalent.

For the purposes of this exercise, a sentence is considered a pangram only if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.
