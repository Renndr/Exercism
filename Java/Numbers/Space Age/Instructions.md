# Age Calculator for Planets

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on various planets:

- **Mercury:** Orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- **Venus:** Orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- **Earth:** Orbital period 1.0 Earth years (365.25 Earth days or 31,557,600 seconds)
- **Mars:** Orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- **Jupiter:** Orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- **Saturn:** Orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- **Uranus:** Orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- **Neptune:** Orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

For example, if someone is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you can calculate that they're approximately 31.69 Earth-years old.

*Note: The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year). The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days. While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise. See [Year on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year) for more ways to measure a year.*
