# Sum Square Difference

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

For example, the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is \((1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025\).

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is \(1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385\).

Hence, the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is \(3025 - 385 = 2640\).
