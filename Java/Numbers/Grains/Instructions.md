# Gigasecond Anniversary Calculator

The conventional way of measuring time with 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour can be quite convoluted. Instead, consider expressing time intervals solely in seconds and use metric system prefixes for more comprehensible quantities.

For instance:

- A food recipe might instruct you to let the brownies cook in the oven for two kiloseconds (that's two thousand seconds).
- Planning a family trip? Perhaps you'd travel for two megaseconds (that's two million seconds).
- Celebrating a significant milestone? If you and your spouse were married for a thousand million seconds, you'd be celebrating your one gigasecond anniversary.

*Note: If humanity ever colonizes other planets, measuring time could become even more complex. A "year" might refer to a year on Earth or a year on Mars.*

## Instructions

Your task is to determine the date and time one gigasecond after a certain date.

A gigasecond is equivalent to one thousand million seconds, denoted by a one followed by nine zeros.

**Example:**

If you were born on January 24th, 2015, at 22:00 (10:00:00 pm), then you would be a gigasecond old on October 2nd, 2046, at 23:46:40 (11:46:40 pm).
