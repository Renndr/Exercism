Write a function to convert normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans, known for their conquests and innovations, used a unique numeral system based on letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, M. Although they lacked the concept of zero, their numeral system is still employed today. Even the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.

## Examples

- `1` is represented as `I`.
- `10` is represented as `X`.
- `7` is represented as `VII`.

The maximum number supported by this Roman numeral notation is 3,999; the Romans themselves rarely went any higher.

Wikipedia explains that modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately, starting from the leftmost digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To illustrate, let's take the example of the year 1990:

In Roman numerals, 1990 is written as MCMXC:

- 1000 = M
- 900 = CM
- 90 = XC

Another example is the year 2008, represented as MMVIII:

- 2000 = MM
- 8 = VIII
